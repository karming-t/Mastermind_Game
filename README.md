# Python Mastermind Game
First university python project done in my first year.

After learning Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals in my third semester I learnt that structurally, the project wasn't coded in an object oriented way.
This was one of my regrets as any future improvisations and added functionality would prove to be difficult to incorporate.
